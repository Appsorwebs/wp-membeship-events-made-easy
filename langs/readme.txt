## Translations and how to translate 

You can find the latest versions of language files [here](https://github.com/liedekef/events-made-easy/tree/main/langs)

Here is how to translate any string in a language of your choice:

First, download and install poedit (or any language editor that can handle ".po" files). Then open the .po language file of choice (it is already merged with the “template file” events-made-easy.pot). Then you’ll see all strings not correctly translated/fuzzy/... . It’s very easy (and exactly like the web interface on the wordpress translation site). Once you press save (after you finished editing), poedit created (compiles) the .mo file for you, so you can then send me the .po and .mo file. Or create a pull request on github with the new files.

I sometimes forget to update the language files, so drop me a hint me when you think something is out of date
